# RUSTYCOPIER

Its a copier implemented in rust programming language . I'm try to use the basic features of this great language that I learned from this awesome book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

## Installation

### Cargo (most platforms)

If you have Cargo installed, you can compile & install from source: (Works with Stable Rust >=1.26)

```bash
cargo install rustycopier
```
